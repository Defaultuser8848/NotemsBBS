### (II) Prohibited
You should not do the following on this forum:
 1. Insult/attack others;
 2. Attempt to use code to destroy the forum;
 3. Repeatedly post the same content in large quantities, affecting others' reading experience (spamming).
 > (1) Posting a small amount of non-repetitive, low-value content does not fall under this category.

### (III) Other Actions We Prefer You Not to Take
 1. Knowingly apply for permissions without meeting the requirements;
 2. Destroy note.ms pages.

## III. Measures

(I) For "Permitted Behaviors," the site management team will provide support and will prevent users attempting to disrupt such behaviors when necessary;

(II) For "Strictly Prohibited," the site management team will issue at most one warning. Repeat offenders will not be warned and will be directly banned. In severe cases, we will report to the law enforcement authorities of the People's Republic of China;

(III) For "Prohibited," the site management team will impose penalties based on the situation, including: warnings, hiding posts, bans ranging from three days to 365 days, removal of membership, etc. Penalties for repeat offenders should be increased accordingly.

(IV) Supplementary Measures
1. For meaningless permission applications, the site management team can conduct a violation group review;
2. For those who repeatedly post a large amount of content affecting others' reading experience, after warnings prove ineffective, a ban from two to ten days will be imposed.

## IV. Classification and Details of Penalties on This Site

(I) Warning

(II) Hiding

(III) Ban

(IV) Removal of Membership

(V) Blacklisting IP


### (VI) Penalty Details
Unless it is content specified in the "Prohibited Behaviors" section, or behavior that most people consider to be a significant principled error, penalties should not be imposed.

### (VII) Ban Details
1. Bans are targeted at individuals, not usernames or IP ranges. If one account of an individual is penalized, other accounts will be penalized simultaneously;
2. Bans of 60 days or less and bans resulting from "Strictly Prohibited" behaviors can be decided by a single administrator;
3. Bans exceeding 60 days are to be decided by any member of the site management team.

## V. Appeals
If you are dissatisfied with or have questions about the penalty, you should first inquire with the management personnel who penalized you. If you still believe the penalty is unreasonable or have questions after inquiring, you can directly appeal to the site management team via email, posting, or the feedback function.

## VI. Jury
If you are still dissatisfied with the appeal result, you can request a jury with the support of one management personnel or three verified members.

### (I) Jury Details
1. The jury is organized by the site management team;
2. The jury requires the participation of at least half of the administrators, and you can also request one to two verified members to participate;
3. The jury's decision is final and cannot be appealed.


### (II) Malicious Appeals
If the facts are clear and the evidence is conclusive, and the person still appeals with an extremely bad attitude, the site management team can extend the penalty period to 1.2 to 1.5 times the original period and revoke the right to appeal.

## Notice:If you register an account, it means that you have carefully read and fully agree to the terms of this site.
