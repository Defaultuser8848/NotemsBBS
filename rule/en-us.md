# Temporary Site Rules Amendment VI English Version
> If there are discrepancies, Chinese version shall prevail.

## I. Preamble  
> To regulate user behavior and maintain site order, combining experience and rules from the old site, implementing the principle of "maximum freedom" by Anonymoususer and the "keep it simple" theory by 4n0n4me, after discussions by the site owner group and the site management team, these site rules are established.

## II. Permitted Behaviors
You are free to do the following on this forum:

 (I) Discuss content on Note.ms;
 
 (II) Discuss methods for dealing with destructive organizations;
 
 (III) Or just chat.

## III. Prohibited Behaviors

### (I) Strictly Prohibited
No one is allowed to do the following on this forum:
 1. Post/communicate content that violates the laws and administrative regulations of the People's Republic of China;
 2. Post/communicate restricted content;
 3. Provide computer virus programs without explanation;
 4. Post/communicate any political, military-related content or content that implies such themes.

For the above content, in severe cases, we may report to the law enforcement authorities of the People's Republic of China.

### (II) Prohibited
You should not do the following on this forum:
 1. Insult/attack others;
 2. Attempt to use code to destroy the forum;
 3. Repeatedly post the same content in large quantities, affecting others' reading experience (spamming).
    - Posting a small amount of non-repetitive, low-value content does not fall under this category.
 5. Impersonate others for deception, especially if it's for obtaining technology, permissions, or impersonating administrators/famous individuals, which will be severely punished. If it constitutes fraud, it will be handled according to the third section, second clause.
 6. Post sensitive technology in public areas, which if discovered by the destructors and causes certain consequences

### (III) Other Actions We Prefer You Not to Take
 1. Knowingly apply for permissions without meeting the requirements;
 2. Destroy note.ms pages.
    - This is a great disrespect to the labor of the page maintainers, so it will be severely punished, and maliciously modifying others' messages also falls under this category.

## IV. Measures

(I) For "Permitted Behaviors," the site management team will provide support and will prevent users attempting to disrupt such behaviors when necessary;

(II) For "Strictly Prohibited," the site management team will issue at most one warning. Repeat offenders will not be warned and will be directly banned. In severe cases, we will report to the law enforcement authorities of the People's Republic of China;

(III) For "Prohibited," the site management team will impose penalties based on the situation, including: warnings, hiding posts, bans ranging from three days to 365 days, removal of membership, etc. Penalties for repeat offenders should be increased accordingly.

(IV) Supplementary Measures
- For meaningless permission applications, the site management team can conduct a violation group review;
- For those who repeatedly post a large amount of content affecting others' reading experience, after warnings prove ineffective, a ban from two to ten days will be imposed.
- For destroying Note.ms pages, in addition to the penalties mentioned above, the protection organization will be commissioned to investigate and combat, and their misdeeds will be publicized. If the destroyer is not a site member but has damaged a page with certain connections to the site, the site can publicize their misdeeds and commission the protection organization to investigate and combat. If this person joins the site later, they will be immediately banned.

## V. Classification and Details of Penalties on This Site

(I) Warning
(II) Hiding
(III) Ban
(IV) Removal of Membership
(V) Blacklisting IP

### (VI) Penalty Details
Unless it is content specified in the "Prohibited Behaviors" section, or behavior that most people consider to be a significant principled error, penalties should not be imposed.

### (VII) Ban Details
1. Bans are targeted at individuals, not usernames or IP ranges. If one account of an individual is penalized, other accounts will be penalized simultaneously;
2. Bans of 60 days or less and bans resulting from "Strictly Prohibited" behaviors can be decided by a single administrator;
3. Bans exceeding 60 days are to be decided by any member of the site management team.

## VI. Appeals
If you are dissatisfied with or have questions about the penalty, you should first inquire with the management personnel who penalized you. If you still believe the penalty is unreasonable or have questions after inquiring, you can directly appeal to the site owner group via email, posts, or the feedback function.

- Specifically, for penalties resulting from "Prohibited Behaviors," if the penalty was imposed by a single administrator, involves no more than three users, and all are site members, you can appeal to the chief administrator (provided the chief administrator is not involved in the dispute).

## VII. Jury
If you are still dissatisfied with the appeal result, you can request a jury with the support of one management personnel or three verified members.

### (I) Details on Jury
1. The jury is organized by the site owner group;
2. The jury requires at least half of the administrators to participate, and you can also request one to two verified members to participate;
3. The jury's decision is final and cannot be appealed.

### (II) Malicious Appeals
If the facts are clear and the evidence is conclusive, and the person still appeals with an extremely bad attitude, the site owner group can extend the penalty period to 1.2 to 1.5 times the original and revoke the right to appeal.

## Note: By registering an account, you indicate that you have carefully read and fully agree to the site rules.
